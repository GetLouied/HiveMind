# HiveMind
HiveMind - ZTM Landing Page Project for the Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Utilized Clock Cursor from [Proxy-99](https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects/blob/master/readme.md)

## The Rules

You HAVE TO use two things from Creative Tim

* [Starter Project](https://github.com/timcreative/udemy-nuk)

* [NOW UI Kit](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/now-ui-kit)

You will use those to start off the project but you can customaize or add to it whatever you like afterwards. Be creative.

Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.
